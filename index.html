    <h1>Sailing Tracker (alpha)</h1>

    Sailingtracker is not being developed at the moment. 

<!--
    <p>You have found the development site of Sailing Tracker. Sailing
    Tracker is an easy-to-use GPS tracker for sailing races. It is
    installed in your mobile phone and uses its internal or external
    GPS device.</p>

    <p><a href="index2.html">Click here</a> to see the races.</p>

<!--
    <h2>Install the client</h2> 

    <p>The most current version is 1.2.0 released on 30.5.2010.</p>

    <p>The client can be found
    at <a href="st.jar">http://sailingtracker.com/st.jar</a>. The
    client requires a MIDP 2.0 enabled mobile phone with an external
    or internal GPS receiver. For example, most recent Nokia phones
    will work -- except the N900. Also RIM BlackBerry phones should
    work.</p>
 
    <p>The easiest way to install the client is to type in the above
    address into your mobile phone's browser. The phone will then
    immediately start downloading and installing the client. Tip: you
    can also text the address to your friend to let them install also
    the client easily.</p>

    <p class="notice"><b>Notice to users:</b> versions older than
    1.1.94 (released 27.5.2010) rely on the device clock instead of
    the accurate GPS clock. If you are using an older version, please
    update or at least make sure your device clock is acurately in
    synch with a GPS clock.</p>

    <h2>Get the tracks</h2>
   
    <p>When you upload tracks from the mobile client, they will appear
in our <a href="index2.html">tracks</a> collection.</p>

    <p>You can get the track in GPX format if you want to store it on
    your own computer. Just click on the track link with the right
    mouse button an select save.</p>

    <h2>Feedback, problems?</h2>

    <p>The reason for releasing this project at this early stage is to
    get feedback. If you like the concept or if you have any problems
    with it, please send feedback
    to <a href="mailto:sailingtracker@yahoo.com">sailingtracker@yahoo.com</a>.
    Regardless of the type of feedback you are giving, please tell me
    the <em>type of phone</em> (make and model, e.g. "Nokia E51 with
    external GPS (Nokia XXX1111)") you were using so we can gather a
    database of the models this project already works on.</p>

    <p>You can get help from and discuss with other users in
    the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=153700986412">Sailing
    Tracker Users' Group</a> in Facebook.</p>

    <h2>Latest Changes</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>1.2.0</dt><dd>Changed tracker to only synch with the GPS
        clock in the beginning of tracking instead of quering it every
        second. This reduces the battery usage and makes the client more
	responsive. Device clock should still be kept within seconds of
        local GPS time.</dd>
      <dt>1.1.94</dt><dd>Changed tracker to use GPS clock instead of
        system time. This is important when playing back races between
        multiple boats. Other features: "Check for updates" option in
        main menu; "Upload now?" dialog after tracking has
        stopped.</dd>
      <dt>1.1.79</dt><dd>Fixed problem in track storage that caused
	GPS data to be uploaded in undefined order (noticed on Nokia
	N97).</dd>
      <dt>1.1.78</dt><dd>Fixed problem in track display that caused
	system crash on Nokia E51</dd>    
    </dl>
